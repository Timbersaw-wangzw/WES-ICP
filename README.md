# WES-ICP
This repository includes the source code of the paper Robust Point Clouds Registration with Point-to-point $l_p$ Distance Constraints in Large-scaleÂ Metrology.
This code was written by MATLAB.
# Introduction
The program includes the following three source point clouds and the same target point clouds.
Those source point clouds have been coarse transformed.
```
source point clouds:
- coarse_source_points0.70.txt
- coarse_source_points0.6.txt
- coarse_source_points0.5.txt
target point clouds:
- target points.txt
```
The program includes three algorithms
```
1. sparse point to point
2. sparse point to plane
3. WES-ICP
```
you can run directly `mainICP.m` to see the results.
